# Intern python test

## Information to know

### How to pass

Please **send en email** to share your solution. If passed, you will be invited for next interview

### Next step

You will have to **present and explain** your code during the follow up interview with the tech lead

## Tests

### Test1

Given two strings `needle` and `haystack`, return the index of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`, or -1 if `needle` is not part of `haystack`.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
Output: 2
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
Output: -1
```

### Test2

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```

#### Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```
